== Welcome to appNG Scheduler

appNG Scheduler is an appNG privileged application, providing job scheduling services.

=== Scheduler Execution Records
The scheduler records each execution of a scheduled job and also manual triggered executions. It saves the site, application and job name. It saves the start- and enddate as well as the duration in seconds. A scheduler job can provide some result information and custom data which are stored as well. Additionally the scheduler saves stacktraces if a job is interrupted by an exception.

  
==== REST API
The records of job executions are provided by a REST API. This is useful for writing monitoring checks to assure that important jobs has been executed successfully. To enable the REST API, the application property `bearerToken` has to be filled with a non-blank value. This bearer token is also a shared secret to be used as authentification header by the consuming application. 

The API is available at:

<host>/service/<site-name>/appng-scheduler/rest/jobRecords

There are some filter which can be provided as GET parameter

* application: filter for application name
* job: filter for job name
* startedAfter: filter for jobs with start time is after given time (format yyyy.MM.dd hh:mm:ss)
* startedBefore: filter for jobs where start time is before given time (format yyyy.MM.dd hh:mm:ss)
* result: SUCCEESS or FAIL to filter for successful or failed jobs
* minDuration: filter for jobs with a duration in seconds which equal or higher than the given value

==== Icinga/Nagios check script
Job executions can be monitored by icinga or nagios. A check script is available at scripts/icinga. With the range definition it is possible 
to check each kind of minimum or maximum number of executions for a certain job in a configurable time period. Check the usage of the script 
with --help
